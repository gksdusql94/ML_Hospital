# Project Name: Diabetes Readmission Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital based on various clinical, demographic, and text-based data. The dataset consists of 8,000 patient records, and the goal is to build a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of hospital readmission.

## 1. Data Preprocessing
Before building the model, we performed the following preprocessing steps:
- Columns with excessive missing values (e.g., `max_glu_serum`) were removed.
- Categorical columns were encoded using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.
- Numerical columns were standardized using `StandardScaler` to normalize the data.
- Binary columns like `change` and `diabetesMed` were mapped to `0` (No) and `1` (Yes).
By handling missing data and encoding categorical variables, the dataset was prepared for machine learning model training.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We conducted a detailed analysis of the dataset to understand the distribution of the target variable and to identify correlations between numerical features. Visualizations like bar plots and heatmaps helped in this process.
  ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4)) # Visualize the target variable distribution
    sns.countplot(x='readmitted', data=df)
    plt.title('Distribution of Readmitted Patients')
    plt.xlabel('Readmitted')
    plt.ylabel('Count')
    plt.show()
